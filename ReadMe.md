root@KenDCon:~#

Technologist made with 💚 in Virginia for the betterment of the 🌎

now everything's our technology

this world our classroom, our laboratory, and an uncertain future society means a lot more than just me

so together we build, getting stronger each time

we collaborate, create, design and combine

cause we are the makers, the modders, the dreamers. the hackers, creators, designers, and schemers

we're the 'what if?' And 'I wonder why?' we're about thinking, tinkering and give it a try

every problem just an opportunity to improve our lives, our world, our community

what can we build? and what can we make? what can we fix? and what can we break?

and as we learn, we play, we explore and race, we help make the world a better place.

and together...we make the future!
